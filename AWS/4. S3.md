It is like a cloud hard drive which is not meant to have high IO operations 
1. Objects are stored with data, meta data and unique id 
2. Scales with limited and no limit storage 
3. Supports multiple read and write no locks 

It can have 0 bytes and 5 TB of files


S3 storage classes
	1. S3 Standard 
		1. Fast 99.99% available 
		2. 11 9's durability 
		3. Replicate across at least 3 Availability zones
	2. S3 intelligent Tiering 
		1. Use the ML model to see usage and size of the files to have proper class of it 
		2. Data will move to the proper and appropriate storage class 
	3. S3 Standard-IA
		1. Cheaper if we access a file less than once a month
		2. Additional retrieval fee applies 50% less than standard
	4. S3 one zone IA
		1. Still fast but availability is 99.5% but cheaper by 20% than standard 
		2. Data can get lost 
	5. S3 Glacier 
		1. for log term cold storage 
		2. Retrieval can take mins to hours 
	6. S3 Glacier Deep archive 
		1. cheapest
		2. data retrieval can take 12 hours 

AWS Snow family

1. Snow cone 
	1. Two models 
		1. 8TB storage 
		2. 14 TB Storage
2. Snow ball edge
	1. There are 4 type but break into 2
		1. Storage optimized 80 TB
		2. Compute Optimized 39.5TB
