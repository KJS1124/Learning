# Fundamental Propositions

1. The root causes of transition failure always lie in a pernicious (harmful) interaction between the situation, with its opportunities and pitfalls, and the individual, with his or her strengths and vulnerabilities. Transition failures happen when new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or ack the skill and flexibility to adapt to them
2. The second proposition is that there are systematic methods that leaders can employ to both lessen the likelihood of failure and reach the breakeven point faster. The key, then, is to match your strategy to the situation
3. The third proposition is that the overriding goal in a transition is to build momentum by creating virtuous cycles that build credibility and by avoiding getting caught in vicious cycles that damage credibility. The new leader behaves more like a virus: Her early actions alienate potential supporters, undermine her credibility, and stimulate defensive reactions. As a vicious cycle takes hold, the organizationâ€™s immune system gets activated and the new leader is attacked by clumps of killer cells, encapsulated, and finally expelled.
4. The fourth proposition is that transitions are a crucible for leadership development and should be managed accordingly. Transition acceleration skills should be taught to people who are in transition, so that talented people do not drown unnecessarily.
5. Adoption of a standard framework for accelerating transitions can yield big returns for organizations
